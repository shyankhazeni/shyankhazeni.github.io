### CPSC 120

* Lab 6 Part 1

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because I this was the first lab that
    produced a pattern which was one step closer to outputting a picture.
    I used the increment operator in a way that I have not thought of before
    which expanded my ability to aproach problems.

* Lab 6 Part 2

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because it was a lab I really struggled and
    still succeeded. I struggled on asking the user if the want to play again.
    Even though it seems simple now, it taught me how to research and solve
    problems I have when coding.

* Lab 7 Part 1

    Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because it taught me how to call functions.
T   his is a very important skill because it makes your code much more
    organized and allows the function to be used many times.
